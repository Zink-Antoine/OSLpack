# OSLpack

some useful functions to analyze and plot OSL curves from my point of view based on RLum-package and WinBUGS (package R2WinBUGS).

This package required _WinBUGS 1.4_
(in the future it is planned to use _OpenBUGS_ on Mac as well)

The _WinBUGS_ software is available for free at
https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/

indicate the location of the WinBUGS14 folder in .Rprofile, by creating the global option _R2WinBUGS.bugs.directory_
